```r
# This code demonstrates the correct way to subset a data frame
# based on a boolean vector in R.

data <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), b = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))

# Correct subsetting using the boolean vector directly
subset_correct <- data[data$b, ]
print(subset_correct)

# Explanation:
# R's indexing mechanism treats TRUE values as 1 and FALSE values as 0.
# When used for subsetting, it selects rows based on these indices.
# Therefore, using `data$b` directly is sufficient and more efficient than `data$b == TRUE`.
